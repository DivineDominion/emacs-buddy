This is an experiment to setup an Emacs Buddy mentoring to make Emacs
easier to learn. This means you can have an experienced somebody to
periodically contact for your Emacs struggles.

Here a list of people available as buddies:

| Name   | Summary                                                                    | Useful Links                               |
